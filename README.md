## Overview  

Klack for macOS redefines the typing experience by adding realistic mechanical keyboard sounds to your Mac. This sound simulation utility reproduces the distinct click and clack of popular switch types, giving every keystroke a satisfying and professional feel. Whether you’re coding, writing, or browsing, Klack creates an immersive typing atmosphere that’s both nostalgic and modern.  

Designed for Mac users who appreciate precision and customization, Klack offers multiple sound presets inspired by mechanical switches such as Cherry MX, Gateron, and more. You can fine-tune each aspect — volume, frequency, and tone — to achieve the perfect blend of comfort and authenticity.  

Klack operates quietly in the background with negligible performance impact, ensuring your Mac stays fast and responsive. It’s a small but delightful enhancement that adds character to every keystroke, turning even routine tasks into something enjoyable.
